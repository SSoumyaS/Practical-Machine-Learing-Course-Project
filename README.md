# Practical Machine Learning Course Project

This analysis meant to be the basis for the course quiz and a prediction assignment writeup. 
The main goal of the project is to predict the manner in which 6 participants performed some 
exercise as described below. This is the “classe” variable in the training set. The machine 
learning algorithm described here is applied to the 20 test cases available in the test data 
for prediction. Different prediction algorithms like Random forest, Decision Tree and 
Generalized Boosted Model are used and compared for the current case.
